    <hr>
    <p>With a background as a digital designer and more than 15 years of programming 
        experience I have helped companies launch digital products in wide range of categories. From WordPress sites to highly specialized websites, web- and mobile apps built from the ground up.

        My skills are focused around front-end development and JavaScript,
         but I work fluently with everything from UX and digital design to back-end and mobile development.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>
            Originally from the west-coast of Denmark but living in Copenhagen since 2001. 
            I have been using the computer as a creativ 
            outlet since the Commadore 64 and still consider myself to be most of all a digital media craftsman.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy running, sailing, concerts and festivals.. 
            and the occational IPA in my favorite Nørrebro bars.
